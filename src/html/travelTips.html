            <h3>Does Checked Luggage Go to the Final Destination Only?</h3>
            <h4>Luggage and Connecting Flights</h4>
            <p>
                Not all flights are nonstop; for example, you might travel from Los Angeles to Washington, 
                D.C., with a stop in Detroit. If you’re just touching down in an airport for a stop before 
                your connecting flight, it’s not necessary to pick up your checked luggage in the baggage claim. 
                Because the luggage is checked through to your final destination, you can just grab an airport 
                coffee or magazine during the stop and relax, knowing that your luggage will meet you at the final stop.
            </p>

            <h4>Luggage and Layovers</h4>
            <p>
                Some connecting flights have an overnight layover, depending on your travel itinerary. In this situation, 
                it’s possible that the airline has not checked your luggage through to the final destination. If you have 
                an overnight layover, you can request to retrieve your luggage at baggage claim so that you have all of 
                your items with you. However, you'll need to recheck your luggage in the morning, so plan additional time 
                for going through security again. Different airlines have different rules about overnight layovers and 
                checked luggage, so ask ahead of time to avoid confusion.
            </p>

            <h4>Multiple Carriers, Multiple Rules</h4>
            <p>
                Your checked luggage might not head directly to your final destination if you have connecting flights 
                operated by different airlines, so be sure to ask at the ticket counter. Some airlines require that you 
                retrieve your checked luggage and recheck it with the connecting airline for tickets involving multiple 
                carriers. Other airlines that frequently operate in association with each other will check your bags all 
                the way through to your final destination, regardless of whether you're flying on two or even three 
                different airlines. When planning your trip, check with the airline to determine whether your bags will 
                be checked all the way through to your final destination.

            <h3>What Are My Rights As a USA Citizen?</h3>
            <h4>General Rights</h4>
            <p>
                U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services condenses the rights of all American citizens into six basic 
                themes. Citizens have the right to free expression and to worship according to their beliefs. They have 
                the right to a trial by jury that is provided promptly and without bias. They hold the right to elect 
                public officials through voting and they have the right to run for elected offices, themselves. Citizens 
                also reserve the right to apply for employment within federal offices.
            </p>

            <h4>In the Bill of Rights</h4>
            <p>
                The Bill of Rights addresses the majority of citizens' rights. The first amendment covers the freedom of 
                religion, press and expression and specifically prohibits Congress from making any rulings to the contrary. 
                The second amendment preserves the right of the citizens to have weapons and form a militia. The third 
                amendment prohibits the government from forcing citizens to house soldiers in their homes. The fourth 
                amendment protects citizens from unreasonable searches or seizures of their property. The fifth amendment 
                ensures that the government cannot take property from citizens without compensation and establishes some 
                of the conditions for a fair trial. The sixth and seventh amendments ensure that citizens receive a trial 
                before a jury and that it is timely. The eighth amendment outlaws cruel and unusual punishment. The ninth 
                amendment asserts that the Bill of Rights, itself, should not be interpreted as the only rights that U.S. 
                citizens should enjoy. The 10th amendment gives any power that is not specifically attributed to the 
                United States government in the Constitution to the individual states or to the citizens.
            </p>

            <h4>Additional Amendments</h4>
            <p>
                After the Bill of Rights, additional amendments further clarify and extend U.S. citizens' rights. For 
                example, amendment 14 specifies that anyone born in or naturalized in the United States is a U.S. citizen. 
                The amendment also establishes the practice of representing individual states within the legislative branch. 
                The 13th amendment abolishes slavery and the 15th and 19th amendments establish that citizens' rights cannot 
                be withheld on account of race, color or gender.
